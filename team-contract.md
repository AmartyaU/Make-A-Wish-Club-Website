5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

- Scribe: takes notes in team meetings to reference back to and keeps all members updated with tasks, especially those who were unable to physically attend – Amartya

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
- Logistics person will hold members accountable by sending meeting reminders. If unable to attend, the respective member must notify them within 24 hours.
- Will designate specific, measurable tasks for each member to complete throughout the project, which would make identifying effort and completion clear
- If a member does not complete his/her designated tasks by the time of a Milestone deadline then other members will not accommodate, and instead will note in the markdown document said member’s failure to do so.
- If a member is continuously late or not completing assignments, the team will initiate an intervention to discuss why they are acting the way they are, and what procedures we can do to fix this issue. Furthermore, such member will need to bring group snacks to a future meeting.
- Because the team has already spoken to both the TA’s and Professor Harms concerning the unresponsive fourth member, the Team has decided to move on and proceed working on this project as though she were not a part of the group.

- Communication is key. We hope to cultivate a supportive and open environment amongst the members.  Should disagreement arise within our team, we expect all teammates to feel comfortable to voicing their opinions and grievances.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Consider adding a clause about how you will make this experience fun!)
- Change up locations each meeting!
- Bring snacks if you want!!
